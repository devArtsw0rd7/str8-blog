<p>Today is my first official day as a developer! So I’m gonna be writing tons of code, committing… wait, what’s that?</p>

<p>I have to drive 3 hours to Denver to get fingerprinted? Oh…</p>

<p>So I set up an appointment to get fingerprinted (the life of a government contractor…) this morning. My parents are in town visiting, and so my dad and I drove up together.</p>

<p>I emailed back and forth with my boss/supervisor/not sure what his official job title is as of yet (the dude that interviewed me initially) on my iPhone11 as we drove, and I tried to mitigate my internal ‘question-asker’ as much as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, he asked me to give him an “EOD Update”… so an “End-of-day update” I’m assuming… just let him know where I’m at.</p>

<p>I asked for clarification on the frequency of emails, but he shrugged it off, so I’m guessing ‘as-needed’ or keep everything to the EOD if possible?</p>

<p>The process of fingerprinting was pretty straightforward and only took about 20 minutes. Afterwards dad and I ran some errands and had some Cuban food!</p>

<p>Once home I completed my initial on-boarding paperwork, made a few more library runs to scan documents, then sent off the first round of completed paperwork.</p>

<p>Paperwork - 1    <br />
Coding - 0</p>

<p>After logging my hours via the company timesheet app, I decided to set up this blog using GitHub pages, Jekyll, Ruby, and Visual Studio Code. Yay for learning new technologies!</p>
