<h2 id="what-i-actually-got-done">What I actually got doneâ€¦</h2>

<p>Lots of meetings!</p>

<p>Close study of the VBMS Core User Guide and trying to understand exactly what it is that TigerTest team does in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>Additionally, Iâ€™m finding that there are often impediments to getting things done. 
Most often this has to do with the technical bits and pieces of access, authorization, and authentication.</p>

<h2 id="pieces-are-starting-to-come-together">Pieces are starting to come together</h2>

<p>I was able to watch a recorded training that Joe Mc did in May concerning the manual data creation processâ€¦ long and brutal, but starting to make the process make more sense.</p>

<p>I am brain dead!</p>
