I"£<h2 id="stand-up">Stand-up</h2>

<p>My lead changed the morning standup to 8:00 am my time, so I got to sleep in a bit today!</p>

<p>1) What did you do yesterday?
   I knocked out 5 TMS trainings.
2) What will you do today?
   Pending Internet speeds, I should be able to finish the TMS trainings, then I will also be finishig up forms (NDA and Remote issuance SEF form) for Booz Allen Hamilton, as my background check is complete and I‚Äôm moving on to ‚ÄòGemalto remote issuance.‚Äô 
3) Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?
   Internet speeds. The joys of rural Internet‚Ä¶ I looked at costs of buying a mobile hotspot from AT&amp;T vs just paying for more bandwidth from my ISP, and I‚Äôm still mulling it over. I‚Äôm kinda leaning towards the mobile hotspot because it is cheaper in the long run and I could have the Internet wherevver there‚Äôs a cell signal, but it makes me nervous too. Might be nce to just pay for more bandwidth‚Ä¶
   Also, the speed at which people email me back. Lots of newbie questions‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="the-joys-of-government-work">The Joys of Government Work</h2>

<p>So the background check to end all background checks got pushed back to me because I didn‚Äôt type out ‚ÄúCounty Road‚Äù (I did Co Rd instead)‚Ä¶</p>

<p>As a result I had to effectively go through the entire process again. Ugh. Sometimes I wonder if they make things intentionally irksome just to see if we‚Äôll put up with it‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="backlog-refinement-meeting">Backlog Refinement Meeting</h2>

<p>So we had a ‚Äòbacklog refinement meeting‚Äô scheduled for 2 hours. 
Notes from the meeting:</p>

<p>Discussion/whiteboarding requirements</p>

<p>John- dev lead for a scrum team
Grant is the dev lead for Pension automation- make sure we‚Äôre on the right path and next steps laid out correctly</p>

<p>API solution
proof of concept- burial and DIC</p>

<p>create veteran
gen address
gen dependent
gen initial claim</p>

<p>rating/word process? not yet</p>

<p>NEXT ITERATION: configurable based on type of claim</p>

<p>-pass in a log to overwrite generated</p>

<p>Support setting up their military service history?</p>

<p>-time enrolled?
-retired?</p>

<p>EAD/RAD
Verified service?
Active duty?
Character service=&gt; Honorably/Dishonorably discharged?</p>

<p>Test positive/negative cases</p>

<p>Needs to be configurable right out of the box.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Veteran/dependent creation</li>
  <li>Claim</li>
  <li>Rating</li>
  <li>Award</li>
</ol>

<p>Pick standard scenarios
Burial
-ServiceConnected, NonServiceConnected</p>

<p>DIC
-dependent is child/spouse/parent</p>

<p>Create a utility to quickly spin up veterans for use in testing</p>

<p>without making a change or changing code</p>

<p>test automation</p>

<p>ad hoc</p>

<p>Moving towards a web application=&gt;</p>

<p>library/parameterized function
UI/database on top of it may be a next step</p>

<p>regression testing- certain data we always need</p>

<p>yml file (more complex data structures)
-defaults, override defaults</p>

<p>Tool is Currently JSON (Dictionary/Hashmap)
No database issue = Generate file numbers with many people running the tool (concurrency)</p>

<p>9 digit (SSN-like)
Social and claim #
CXXXXXXXX (8 digit number)
Vets w/o SSN</p>

<p>BIRLS- search all in list</p>

<p>Java =&gt;</p>

<p>implements Serializable</p>

<p>menu system/CL tool</p>

<p>pick a file number associated with 
service calls</p>

<p>CLINT</p>

<p>UI</p>
<ol>
  <li>flask</li>
  <li>oracle</li>
  <li>Amazon RDS</li>
  <li>kivy</li>
</ol>

<p>BPD-side
-populate BPD Schema from Forms‚Ä¶can create scenario based data</p>

<p>users set up BPD themselves</p>

<p>label this is vet data, this is claimant data</p>

<p>How are we generating names?</p>

<p>pick up where you left off
data for a given scenario</p>

<p>May need fields that are blank for non-required fields (pass in null?)</p>

<p>directory finder in python</p>

<h2 id="plan-it-poker">Plan-it Poker</h2>

<p>For the uninitiated (like me today‚Ä¶), Plan-it Poker is basically a consensus-creating interface with digital playing cards on the screen, each with a number on it that corresponds to a description of work (can be easy, medium, hard‚Ä¶ s, m, l‚Ä¶ 1, 2, 3, etc.). The Scrum master prompts everyone to read a particular story and click on the card with the number that they think most closely matches the scope of the story‚Äôs work. Then everyone‚Äôs number is revealed, a short discussion/explanation of everyone‚Äôs choices ensues, then the Scrum master calls for a revote. Rinse and repeat until there is a consensus. Good stuff!</p>

<h2 id="stuff-to-investigatelearn">Stuff to investigate/learn</h2>

<p>JSON Schema
How to pass in/select an environment (DEV or TST)
Call orchestrator? Workflow 
api service calls (configurable)
Xray test management</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>The meeting was 2 hours long, and afterwards I needed a break. I worked out for an hour, picked up Milo, then got back to my trainings. I worked on another training, but the Internet/VA server was really slow, so I was only able to finish up one more module. My brain is getting tired pretty quickly after 3 pm, so I need to work on getting lots done in the mornings.</p>

<h2 id="gfe">GFE!</h2>

<p>My ‚ÄúGovernemnt Furnished Equipment‚Äù came today! I was provided with a 2020 MacBook Pro [MacBookPro16,2] (Silver 13-inch with Four Thunderbolt 3 ports, 2.0GHz QC i5, 16GB LPDDR4X memory, 512 GB SSD, Touch Bar/Touch ID)! Can‚Äôt wait to get developing!</p>
