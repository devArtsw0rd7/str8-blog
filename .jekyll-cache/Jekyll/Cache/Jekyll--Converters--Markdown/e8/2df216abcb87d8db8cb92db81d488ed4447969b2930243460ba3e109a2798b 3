I"X<h2 id="end-of-first-full-week">End of first full week</h2>

<p>This has been a good first week. I‚Äôm a little worn out by staring at a screen for so long (going to have to figure out a better rhythm of stepping away, exercising, etc.), but other than that it was mostly low key.</p>

<p>I had two meetings today, one at 6:45 am and one at 8 am‚Ä¶ so I got up, showered, got ready, and the Scrum master cancelled them both (at 6:45 am) and rescheduled for 9 am.</p>

<p>sigh‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="the-friday-plan">The Friday Plan</h2>

<p>So what‚Äôs my plan for today? I sent all of my TMS training certificates to my contact at BAH, and she let me know I was missing one this morning. Not sure how I missed one, but ok! There were 11 mandated trainings and I had 11 different certificates‚Ä¶ oh well.</p>

<p>It was very similar, if not exactly the same as the last one I did yesterday about Information Security, so I knocked it out in less than 10 minutes and sent it off.</p>

<p>Here are the things I can/need to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self-guided training on topics I heard in meetings that I know nothing about:
    <ol>
      <li>Camunda</li>
      <li>Oracle Database/ Java</li>
      <li>Kivy (Python UI toolkit)</li>
      <li>Connecting up Python (Kivy) with an AWS RDS instance and Oracle database</li>
      <li>Some VA-related self-traning (mostly learning some more acronyms‚Ä¶)</li>
      <li>Build a quick flask app with Kivy (maybe try to mock up a basic version of what my fellow Devs are working on)</li>
      <li>Add the ability to see a directory/file structure within an app</li>
      <li>JSON Schema</li>
      <li>Workflow orchestration in Python</li>
      <li>Creating the ability to select a Test or Dev environment in an application (remote development?)</li>
      <li>APIs, service calls</li>
      <li>Xray for Jira</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Email some BAH people about the following:
    <ol>
      <li>How to setup my MacBook Pro according to company/VA policy</li>
      <li>Learn the modules of bah.com (if I‚Äôm authorized‚Ä¶)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Grad school that I‚Äôve been massively neglecting‚Ä¶
    <ol>
      <li>Email Canadian guy in Australia about survey questions</li>
      <li>Build my survey</li>
      <li>Read a ton</li>
      <li>Write a ton</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah, plenty to do today‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="stand-up-retrospective-etc">Stand-up, Retrospective, etc.</h2>

<p>So for today‚Äôs standup, here‚Äôs what I got:</p>

<p>1) Finished up my TMS Trainings, received my laptop</p>

<p>2) VA documents for my PIV, may need to drive to Denver VA office. If not, I‚Äôm going to do some self-guided learning on our tech stack, mainly getting up to speed on Oracle database and Jira stuff.</p>

<p>3) Just waiting on the next steps for onboarding, Slack, etc. &amp; setting up my dev machine.</p>
