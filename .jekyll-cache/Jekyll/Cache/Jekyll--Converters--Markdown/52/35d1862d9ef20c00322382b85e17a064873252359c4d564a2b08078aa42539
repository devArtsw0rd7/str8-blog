<p>Today is my first official day as a developer! So Iâ€™m gonna be writing tons of code, committingâ€¦ wait, whatâ€™s that?</p>

<p>I have to drive 3 hours to Denver to get fingerprinted? Ohâ€¦</p>

<p>So I set up an appointment to get fingerprinted (the life of a government contractorâ€¦) this morning. My parents are in town visiting, and so my dad and I drove up together.</p>

<p>I emailed back and forth with my boss/supervisor/not sure what his official job title is as of yet (the dude that interviewed me initially) on my iPhone11 as we drove, and I tried to mitigate my internal â€˜question-askerâ€™ as much as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, he asked me to give him an â€œEOD Updateâ€â€¦ so an â€œEnd-of-day updateâ€ Iâ€™m assumingâ€¦ just let him know where Iâ€™m at.</p>

<p>I asked for clarification on the frequency of emails, but he shrugged it off, so Iâ€™m guessing â€˜as-neededâ€™ or keep everything to the EOD if possible?</p>

<p>The process of fingerprinting was pretty straightforward and only took about 20 minutes. Afterwards dad and I ran some errands and had some Cuban food!</p>

<p>Once home I completed my initial on-boarding paperwork, made a few more library runs to scan documents, then sent off the first round of completed paperwork.</p>

<p>Paperwork - 1    <br />
Coding - 0</p>

<p>After logging my hours via the company timesheet app, I decided to set up this blog using GitHub pages, Jekyll, Ruby, and Visual Studio Code. Yay for learning new technologies!</p>

<p>Paperwork - 1    <br />
â€œOfficialâ€ Coding - 0    <br />
â€œCode-to-learn/for funâ€- 1</p>

<p>Good times!</p>
