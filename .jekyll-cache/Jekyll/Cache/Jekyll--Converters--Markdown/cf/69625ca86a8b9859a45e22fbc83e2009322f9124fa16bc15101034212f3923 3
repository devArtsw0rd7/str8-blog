<p>The process of joining a new company (especially as a government contractor) involves a lot of paperwork. You’re going to need a decent scanner/printer, a flash drive, and a lot of patience. I’ve been rocking an Epson Workforce 845 for the past 10 years or so, and it has worked well for what I’ve needed it for. Today, however, it began to show it’s age. I was able to scan several documents, but after the first few, it just stopped functioning. I tried various different flash drives, but the Epson wasn’t having any of it.</p>

<p>So… off to the public library! I was able to quickly scan, rename files, and email them to the pertinent people with no problems. Think I’m gonna have to get a new scanner/printer…</p>
