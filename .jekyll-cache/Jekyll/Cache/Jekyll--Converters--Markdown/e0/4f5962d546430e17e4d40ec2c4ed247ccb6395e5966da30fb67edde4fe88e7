<p>Today after our meetings, I jumped on a slack call with Andrew and Sean, which was good. Andrew is trying to get the tool functional, and so lots of debugging and refactoring at this point.</p>

<p>Starting to get to know them better, they seem like good guys.</p>

<p>After lots of debugging, we walked through the override process so I could see it working and Sean could update the Readme.</p>
