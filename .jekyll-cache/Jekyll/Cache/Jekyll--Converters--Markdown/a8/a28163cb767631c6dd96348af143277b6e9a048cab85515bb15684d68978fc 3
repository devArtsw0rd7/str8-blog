<p>I received my offer, signed the digital contract, and we’re off to the races!</p>

<p>I work for an IT company that specializes in serving larger government contractors, so there will be lots of on-boarding work in the coming days and weeks to get clearance, authorization, etc. to be able to access government servers.</p>

<p>Today I received an email from my employer about my development machine (A Macbook!), so hopefully that will come soon.</p>

<p>I set up a new user on my personal MacBook Air to work from until my work dev machine gets here (referenced Frankie Valentine’s dev.to post: <a href="https://dev.to/v3frankie/setup-your-mac-for-development-2020-edition-1c8a">https://dev.to/v3frankie/setup-your-mac-for-development-2020-edition-1c8a</a>). Spent the rest of the day reading e-mails, interpreting PowerPoint slides, and beginning the process of filling out forms.</p>

<p>I also set up an appointment at the government office for Wednesday in Denver.</p>
