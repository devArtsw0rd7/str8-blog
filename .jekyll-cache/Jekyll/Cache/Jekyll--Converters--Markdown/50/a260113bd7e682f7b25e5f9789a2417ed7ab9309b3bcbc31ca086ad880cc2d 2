<p>EOD: Waiting on AWS Tunnel SSH keys to configure my Jumpbox. Gained access to Team GitHub (waiting to be added to the EPMO group) and VA GitHub. Ansley is helping Andrew C and I get licenses to Adobe XD for UI development next week. Received IDM/Kubernetes access. Requested Splunk access, should be good once I have Tunnel access. Andrew C gave me a quick overview of Splunk. Slight snag getting BIP Platform Production &amp; VBMS TestProd Database access, but as I gain access to more CAG desktops, this should hopefully be resolved. Completed my monthly Le‚ÄôFant ‚ÄúTPS report‚Äù (Status report for BAH reporting). And‚Ä¶ done.</p>
