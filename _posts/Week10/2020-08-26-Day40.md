## Standup

### Joe lead standup again today and did a great job!

### Yesterday
* Completed onboarding exercise #9 Pension Automation (Review Pension Automation Background & Overview, Learn Pension Automation terminology)
* Sizing meeting/discussion with Joe to further groom and dial-in our work
* Jira training with Joe Evans
* Completed onboarding exercise #10 GitHub ()
* Researched SAML and Python as well as some Zeep plugin/security items that Andrew needs for 

### Today
* Grooming meeting
* Shadow Andrew as he's working on the REST/SOAP
* Help Sean with documentation
* Tabletop 

### Tomorrow
* Work on sprint items

### Impediments
* Sean's MacBook crashed, out for the day
* Contractors (Andrew and I) don't have webex rooms, so we couldn't connect without Sean

### From other teammates
* None

### What I actually ended up doing
* Couldn't connect with Andrew via chat
* Edited/Feedback on UML diagrams
* Prepped for Tabletop with other developers
* Shadowed Andrew C while completing PEN-4486

### EOD for Slack
EOD: I completed research sub-tasks for the Zeep and SAML token work and completed the BPD data onboarding module. Sean K's MacBook crashed, so he was out all day working on a fix. Andrew C completed PEN-4486 (REST/SOAP Lookup) and then we prepared for our first Tabletop with stakeholders (see attached meeting minutes). Andrew C did an excellent job at the tabletop presenting the VetGen UI architecture and demoed it for stakeholders.
