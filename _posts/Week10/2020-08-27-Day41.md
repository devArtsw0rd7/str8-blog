## Standup

### Ansley is back today

### Yesterday
* Grooming
* Tabletop
* Couldn't connect with Andrew via chat
* Edited/Feedback on UML diagrams
* Prepped for Tabletop with other developers
* Shadowed Andrew C while completing PEN-4486
EOD: I completed research sub-tasks for the Zeep and SAML token work and completed the BPD data onboarding module. Sean K's MacBook crashed, so he was out all day working on a fix. Andrew C completed PEN-4486 (REST/SOAP Lookup) and then we prepared for our first Tabletop with stakeholders (see attached meeting minutes). Andrew C did an excellent job at the tabletop presenting the VetGen UI architecture and demoed it for stakeholders.
