## Standup

### Yesterday
EOD: We continued working on PEN-4487 and defect PEN-4433. Patrick S updated the backend (DEV) and walked us through the request in SOAPUI, but we are still dealing with 'signature/decryption is invalid' and 'encryption key alias' errors. Fixed bug PEN-4410 and updated in Jira, as per Joe E's request. Completed onboarding exercises and worked on monthly status report for Le'fant.
