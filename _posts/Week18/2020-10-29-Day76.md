## Standup- Sprint 40.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD: Created a fix for PEN-5545 and did a code review with AC. He had some suggestions to clean up the code, which I implemented. I may have a question for Mel/Joe Mc around active duty dates, but should be able to do a quick code review tomorrow AM and move it into Ready for QA.

### Today
* Finish PEN-5545
* Bug/Story?
* Cardiologist at 2pm

### Items from Team Members


### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: Worked with AC to continue engineering the solution to PEN-5545. Met with Mel to confirm military service dates. Went to cardiologist appointment, then continued work on PEN-5545. My fix is passing written tests (accounting for future dates and modifying RAD accordingly), but the BIRLS update is encountering inconsistent errors when I run it through vetgen-ui.
