## Standup- Sprint 40.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD: Fixed PEN-6168(button disabled on click). Pulled in PEN-5545 (future military service dates) and began work. Finished Le'Fant status report.

### Today
* PEN-5545 (military service dates)

### Items from Team Members

### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
 EOD: Created a fix for PEN-5455 and did a code review with AC. He had some suggestions to clean up the code, which I implemented. I may have a question for Mel/Joe Mc around active duty dates, but should be able to do a quick code review tomorrow AM and move it into Ready for QA.
