## Standup- Sprint 40.1
  
### Yesterday


### Today

* Le'Fant Status Report

### Items from Team Members
* Mel reaching out to get feedback on how people are using/not using the tool
* Sean & AC in meetings concerning security opportunity we've been battling. Spoke with Clayton and had lots of good insights (security and low/high languages) They spoke with Stephen Quick and Cameron Williams and they have an exposed API to interact with eFolder on a simple level, which is what we need! (Search, upload, retrieve metadata from a file in eFolder). This bypasses security in some form. Uses a JWT token similar to what claims does. They accessed the swagger page yesterday, so they will be rolling on that.

### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
