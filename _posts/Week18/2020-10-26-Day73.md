## Standup- Sprint 40.1
  
### Friday
EOD: Worked bugs. Met with Joe in the afternoon to talk over and work on defects in Jira. I fixed PEN-6168(buttons not disabled on click), PEN-4392 (Remove operation tooltip), and PEN-5693 (restricted characters causing crash/corruption). Completed code review with Sean and AC, moved to Ready for QA. Joe sent back PEN-6168 due to issues with double-clicking the run button and for data corruption due to dots in the filename when saving. I went back and fixed the dots in the file name issue. We moved PEN-5473 (double click) back to the backlog. Updated the support channel with information on how to install new requirements. Met with Mel concerning PEN-5455 (military service dates) and began familiarizing myself with the code and discussing possible solutions with AC. Worked on status report for Le'fant.
