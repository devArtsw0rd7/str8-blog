## Standup- Sprint 40.1
  
### Yesterday
 EOD: No power or internet throughout the day. I tried tethering my MacBook to my phone's mobile hotspot, but the throughput was pretty poor/non-existent. I helped out Jason Dorman on the tigertest-support channel, then worked on PEN-6168 and PEN-5455 until my MacBook's power died at 2 pm my time.  

### Today
* PEN-6168 (button disabled on click)
* PEN-5455 (military service dates)
* Le'Fant Status Report

### Items from Team Members

### Tomorrow
 * PEN-5455 (military service dates)
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: Fixed PEN-6168(button disabled on click). Pulled in PEN-5545 (future military service dates) and began work. Finished Le'Fant status report.
