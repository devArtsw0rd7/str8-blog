### What I actually ended up doing

* Ran into lack of documentation related to the SAML token required for access; contacted Pat Soisson & Dan Ragan for assistance
* Completed onboarding exercise #5 VBMS Core (Created Spouse, Child, & Parent Dependents, Created and Viewed a Contention of PTSD)

* Completed onboarding exercise #7 VBMS Ratings (Learned Ratings terminology, Logged into Ratings, Pulled/Worked/Finalized a Rating)
* Completed onboarding exercise #8 VBMS Awards (Learned Awards terminology, Logged into Awards as different users, Created an Award, added decisions, generated an Award, authorized an Award, and viewed the generated letter in VBMS Core eFolder)

### EOD for Slack
EOD: Andrew C, Sean, and I continued work/research for the docgen stories using the efolder-web-service-sdk provided by John Shipman. We ran into a lack of documentation related to the SAML token required for access. We contacted Pat Soisson (as per the sdk), but he was OOO. Charles and Dan Ragan pointed us towards several other possible POCs to help us move forward. Completed several onboarding exercises related to VBMS Core, Ratings, Awards, and SOAPUI.
