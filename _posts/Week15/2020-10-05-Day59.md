## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: Sean and I got SOAPUI configured and working. We were able to make a valid request to both Dev and Test environments. We were also able to validate the efolder request in our code on SOAPUI.
AS, AC and I were also able to get our mapping of the public key, private key, and keystore correct in the framework. We have an error in our directoryhandler class that we're working through. Once the directoryhandler error is fixed, we should see a positive efolder request. We came a long way in a few hours today.
