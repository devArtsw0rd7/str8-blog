### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing

EOD: Pushed FIX for the SAML token defect PEN-5380-VETGEN-UI: Find_files_by_name not finding public key for SAML injection(eFolder). Resumed work on PEN-4487 with Sean. 

Had to install xmlsec and it's Mac dependencies to properly use Zeep's Signature method:
`brew install libxml2 libxmlsec1 pkg-config`  
`pip install xmlsec`

We are currently stuck on the following error in Zeep's signature.py file:
`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find'`
 
Helped Sarah M. with testgen-ui environment issues in the tigertest-support channel.

Set up GFE, sent Jessica Riggs GFE tracking info
