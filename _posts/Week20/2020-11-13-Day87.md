## Standup- Sprint 41.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD: First half of the day at the cardiologist. Grooming, then worked on PEN-3870 to connect client to VBMS. Met with AC briefly to catch up for the day and discuss Birls update. I was able to confirm the getBirlsRecord service is working, but now need to get the updateBirlsRecord to go through. Still getting the 'No Birls Record Found' when running the Scenario.

### Today
* PEN-3870-Add vetgen-ui support for BIRLS Update (Step 5d)

### Items from Team Members
