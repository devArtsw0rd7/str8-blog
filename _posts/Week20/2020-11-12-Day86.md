## Standup- Sprint 41.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD: Whiteboard meeting w/ AC, Chad, and Greg before DSU (went over how the Scenario stack is created). Met briefly with AC to brainstorm debugging ideas. Formatted BIRLS update calls according to several SOAPUI template scenarios and created Scenarios for each in vetgen-ui. Requests are getting through, but I am running into error code: BPNQ0100- 'No BIRLS record found,' which is preventing vetgen from syncing with VBMS/Share to decease the veteran properly. Need to look into possible environment switching issues or time delay as data propagates throughout the systems.

### Today
* PEN-3870-Add vetgen-ui support for BIRLS Update (Step 5d)

### Items from Team Members


### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: First half of the day at the cardiologist. Grooming, then worked on PEN-3870 to connect client to VBMS. Met with AC briefly to catch up for the day and discuss Birls update. I was able to confirm the getBirlsRecord service is working, but now need to get the updateBirlsRecord to go through. Still getting the 'No Birls Record Found' when running the Scenario.
