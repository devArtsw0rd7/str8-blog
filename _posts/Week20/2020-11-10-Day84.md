## Standup- Sprint 41.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD: DSU, then met with AC regarding PEN-3870 to discuss needed tasks and approaches. Did some initial testing of existing BIRLS update functionality in the tool, but saving is dependent on the save refactor story (PEN-5258). Met with Joe E and Mel regarding PEN-3870. Added a task in Jira, then created 2 new Scenarios to test the BIRLS Update functionality (With and Without Claim). Still need to confirm that the override parameters update/decease the vet in Share/VBMS.
