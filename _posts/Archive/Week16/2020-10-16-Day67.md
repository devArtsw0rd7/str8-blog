## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: We found a discrepancy with our zeep request versus our SOAPUI request. We were looking at the raw output from both SOAPUI and zeep. We found that there is a wsu timestamp (web service timestamp utility) object in the soap request. The wsu timestamp is being injected by SOAPUI in our request (the request we have in our code), and then being sent out to the endpoint. Our zeep output does not have this wsu timestamp. We didn't know it was needed. So we are working to figure out how to generate the wsu timestamp and inject it into our zeep request.

### Today

* Work on SAML token
* Build class to inject Timestamp into zeep request?
* Possibly contact 

### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: Andrew C and I worked on PEN-4487 in the morning. Made small progress, but still ultimately running into AttributeError or SSL Certificate Error depending on our cert configuration. We pivoted to looking at some bugs, and were able to fix defects PEN-5437 and PEN-5438. Andrew C then focused on the Save defect (PEN-5258) and I started researching a fix for the Tooltip bleed defect (PEN-4392).
