## Standup

### Yesterday
Debugging for PEN-4391- VETGEN-UI: App crashes when saving scenario
* If an empty list is passed in, the app will not crash, but the Scenarios are not repopulated - If you close out the tool and re-run it, the saved Scenario is there.
* Need to figure out what to pass in to correctly repopulate the scenarios
  
### Today
* Fix PEN-4817 and PEN-4394. 
* Testing

### Tomorrow
* Same
  
### Impediments
* AIDE issues, Mac issues
