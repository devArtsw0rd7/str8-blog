## Standup- Sprint 41.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD: First half of the day at the cardiologist. Grooming, then worked on PEN-3870 to connect client to VBMS. Met with AC briefly to catch up for the day and discuss Birls update. I was able to confirm the getBirlsRecord service is working, but now need to get the updateBirlsRecord to go through. Still getting the 'No Birls Record Found' when running the Scenario.

### Today
* PEN-3870-Add vetgen-ui support for BIRLS Update (Step 5d)

### Items from Team Members


### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: 
* Met with AC, Greg, and Chad to go over the propertymapper's flatten/unflatten functionality 
* DSU & Retro 
* Met with AC briefly to discuss PEN-3870
* Completed PEN-3870 and updated story/tasks in Jira

GitHub README update
3. **Decease Vet with BIRLS Update**
 * Scenario Configuration: 
  1. Generates a Veteran with dependent 
  2. Creates a new claim with an EP Code and Claim Label of '020 - New' 
  3. Deceases the Vet (Sets the following properties-> Death Date: [configurable by user], Death in SVC: Y, Cause of Death: NATURAL)

* How to decease a veteran using this scenario:
  1. Open the tool using GitHub Desktop
  2. In the file explorer on the right of VSCode, navigate to Data/Scenarios/Saved/Decease Vet with BIRLS Update.json
  3. Scroll to the bottom of the file to find the VetRecordWebService-> updateBirlsRecord
  4. In the override_values section of the updateBirlsRecord call, modify the following death date values between the double quotes (to the right of each colon) to be a few days prior to the date you are running the tool.
    * "DEATH_DAY": "<ENTER the 2-digit death day here>"
    * "DEATH_MONTH": "<ENTER the 2-digit death month here>"
    * "DEATH_CENTURY": "<ENTER the 2-digit death century here>"  (this is the first two digits of '2020')
    * "DEATH_YEAR": "<ENTER the 2-digit death year here>" (this is the last two digits of '2020')
  <!--![](/images/DeceaseVet.png)-->
  5. Save the Decease Vet with BIRLS Update.json file
  6. Open up vetgen.py and right-click-> Run Python File in Terminal (or Option + R on the keyboard)
  7. Click the Run ('play') button on the Decease Vet with BIRLS Update Scenario
  8. Click the Run ('play') button on the Run Screen
  9. Go back to VSCode and navigate to Logs/Standard
  10. Within the Standard directory, find the most recent LOG_SET-<TIMESTAMP> directory (typically the last directory in the list)
  11. Inside the LOG_SET-<TIMESTAMP> directory will be the .json files from each Service/Operation call
  12. Double-click the 'ServiceName - OperationName.json' file that you want to see the data for.
