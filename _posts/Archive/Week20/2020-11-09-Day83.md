## Standup- Sprint 41.1
  
### Friday

Met with AC and Sean to confirm that ratingsManagementService - getRating locks the file, which is does not. Continued to update the readme FAQ. Met with Greg, Chad, Joe Mc, and AC to do a quick overview of the vetgen-UI tool.

### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: DSU, then met with AC regarding PEN-3870 to discuss needed tasks and approaches. Did some initial testing of existing BIRLS update functionality in the tool, but saving is dependent on the save refactor story (PEN-5258). Met with Joe E and Mel regarding PEN-3870. Added a task in Jira, then created 2 new Scenarios to test the BIRLS Update functionality (With and Without Claim). Still need to confirm that the override parameters update/decease the vet in Share/VBMS.
