### What I actually did today

Today after our meetings, I jumped on a slack call with Andrew and Sean, which was good. Andrew is trying to get the tool functional, and so lots of debugging and refactoring at this point. 

Starting to get to know them better, they seem like good guys. 

After lots of debugging, we walked through the override process so I could see it working and Sean could update the Readme.
