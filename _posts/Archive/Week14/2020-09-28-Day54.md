### Impediments
  
### From other teammates

### FEATURE IDEAS/BUG FIXES
* Saving might need to be looked at -  maybe add a listener to the text field so it auto-saves after each character is added?

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: Today we worked on the Security headers for the filenet related services.
We ran into 2 issues:
The structure of the WSSE headers is still off and the error we run into is:
       gov.va.vba.vbms.ws.VbmsWSException: WssVerification Exception - Security Verification Exception GUID: a3d4982d-934a-4dd5-94f4-422d4bced934
When we index splunk for the GUID given as listed above, we only get one partial response:
 [app_name=vbms-efolder-svc build_id=EFS-V1 request_uri=/vbms-efolder-svc/read-v1/eFolderReadService session_id=S_LWPttRNFQT7lNGhHAmXYECN3xqKfV-      eryYpx_3wbhpNnCPRMou!633535448!1601322277713 soj=null span_id=247bb48e7a7b1648 trace_id=247bb48e7a7b1648]
     root_exception=org.opensaml.xml.validation.ValidationException: Signature did not validate against the credential's key
	at org.opensaml.xml.signature.SignatureValidator.validate(SignatureValidator.java:79)
	at org.apache.ws.security.saml.ext.AssertionWrapper.verifySignature(AssertionWrapper.java:626)
	... 21 common frames omitted
        Wrapped by: org.apache.ws.security.WSSecurityException: SAML signature validation failed
â€¦
Which is just an extended stack trace of the error
We lost the example request for the read service, but found it again this afternoon, so at least we have something to compare it against for tomorrow.
