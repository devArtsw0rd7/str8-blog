## Standup

### Yesterday
EOD: Continued working through SAML token issues. Worked with Patrick Soisson to configure the SOAPUI request (which worked in DEV), but the Test environment continues to throw an SSLHandshakeException, and so PEN-4487 is now blocked. Andrew C and I pivoted to work on PEN-5258: Refactor save scenario functionality. Andrew C and I were also able to access Teams with our @ne.bah.com email addresses.
