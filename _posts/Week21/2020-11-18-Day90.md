## Standup- Sprint 41.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD: 
* Updated tigertest-support re the scrolling functionality. 
* Talked with Joe E and pulled in defect PEN-6721 (App crash when selecting removed operation)
* Traced through files related to defect (lists.py, newscenario.py, etc.) to get a sense of what is causing the error (IndexError...if the remove operation button is clicked prior to actually selecting an operation, the index is out of bounds)
* Debugged briefly with AC
* Still need to add some code to handle removing an operation prior to selecting one

### Today
* Dev meeting to go over KivyMD layouts, colors, and chip selectors.
* Defect PEN-6721

### Items from Team Members/Grooming
* Make a section in the README that contains institutional knowledge
* Add a table of contents with internal links to the readme

### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD:
* Dev meeting to go over KivyMD layouts, colors, and chip selectors.
* Worked on Defect PEN-6721
* Grooming
* Met with AC and we found a fix for PEN-6721, but it is dependent on his save refactor fix. We'll get it merged and sorted tomorrow.
