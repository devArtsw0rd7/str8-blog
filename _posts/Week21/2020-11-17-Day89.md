## Standup- Sprint 41.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD: Completed PEN-6591: Improve scroll/touchpad speed. Greg M. tested and moved to Done. Completed tasks for Le'Fant, looked through backlog items, and tested CorpDB access via Jumpbox and GFE.

### Today
* Pulled in defect PEN-6721

### Items from Team Members

### Tomorrow
 
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: 
* Updated tigertest-support re the scrolling functionality. * Talked with Joe E and pulled in defect PEN-6721 (App crash when selecting removed operation)
* Traced through files related to defect (lists.py, newscenario.py, etc.) to get a sense of what is causing the error (IndexError...if the remove operation button is clicked prior to actually selecting an operation, the index is out of bounds)
* Debugged briefly with AC
* Still need to add some code to handle removing an operation prior to selecting one
