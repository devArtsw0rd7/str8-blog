The joy of Microsoft products on a Mac...

### Grooming Session

Python vs. Java
Jython?

Spreadsheet CSV import for tasks

### What I actually did

* Tried to get videos to work (for some reason the 'Initial-API-Framework-Overview' and 'Review of Methods for Claims Test Data' videos will not play. Tried it in all the browsers, tried downloading it, installed Microsoft Silverlight plugin... still no dice.)
* Watched the Claims Script overview
* Looked through DIC Surviving Spouse Data Staging.xlsx
* Read 'Veteran creation and data modification tools.docx' by Sean K.

This contained discussion of the Void testing framework
* Charles fixed the vids for me, so I watched those and took notes
