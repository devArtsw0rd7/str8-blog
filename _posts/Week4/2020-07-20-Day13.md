### Impediments
VA Access

### Items from team members
BPDS Testing tomorrow (Charles)
Command-line tool "tire-kicking"
No one on the team has jumpbox, most with GFE? (Windows)
Need to use the Token to elevate rights to test the command-line tool?
What is % of people using GFE vs JumpBox
Per Sean K, most developers are using JumpBox

#### GFE vs JumpBox
* You can do pretty much everything via GFE
* Updates can slow things down via JumpBox
* JumpBox can be nitpicky and painful to setup

#### Update from Ansley
* Communicated that teams need to stage their own data and not have the expectation that TigerTest will do this for them

#### Command Line Tool Demo
* Log Parser is built, so we are able to see what file numbers are generated
* Additional params can be overridden as per the ReadMe
* Can't say dependent is child, spouse only
* Happy Value workflows/Testing?
* Open up each created record in Share/VBMS (Log out/Log in, see the changes)
* Need to update the ReadMe about how to get the tool up and running
* Try running the tool at the same time (multiple users)
  * Only possible issue would be related to creating multiple duplicate SSNs/IDs
