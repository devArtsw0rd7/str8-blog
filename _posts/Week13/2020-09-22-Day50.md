## Standup

### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
Debugging for PEN-4391- VETGEN-UI: App crashes when saving scenario
* If an empty list is passed in, the app will not crash, but the Scenarios are not repopulated - If you close out the tool and re-run it, the saved Scenario is there.
* Need to figure out what to pass in to correctly repopulate the scenarios

* Uncovered possible additional defect with saving:
  * Click the + (New Scenario) button
  * Services-Operations List should be empty
  * Enter a filename to save, click the save icon
  * Tool returns to empty home screen
  * Close tool
  * Re-run tool
  * Saved scenario should be first in the list above default scenario
  * Click Edit Scenario button
  * Scenario has 14 copies of default scenario Services-Operations
EOD:
Worked on PEN-4391- VETGEN-UI: App crashes when saving scenario.
