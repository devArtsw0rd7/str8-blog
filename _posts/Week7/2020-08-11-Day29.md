### EOD Update for Slack

EOD: The Andrews and I had a great conversation with Matt Fetyko, and Taylor Jackwood and have good direction on the ratings service now. We will discuss the impact in refinement tomorrow, as we will have to adjust stories and sub-tasks accordingly. The design on the Edit/New Scenario screen was completed for PEN-3930. I also completed building the design and building screen objects for PEN-3928. Andrew C. has been implementing the logging system into the handler for PEN-2668.

EOD: Gained access to Jira/Confluence as well as CAG WEBTEST desktop (Thanks Ansley!). Andrew and Sean and I finished the Design work for PEN-3930. I received my Tunnel access key, but had some issues getting the script to run... We will spend some time getting that connected tomorrow. Began work on the Build New/Edit Scenario Page Objects subtask for PEN-3930.
