## Self-guided Learning

Still nothing from BAH or Le'Fant...

So I'm honing my Java skills and re-learning some Javascript via Udemy!

## 12:25pm Update

Got messaged from Nate Carlson that I will be joining Taiyangshou. I will be working on Fiduciary ART (adverse reaction tracking?) as a QA Engineer.  

Taiyangshou:
Matt Fetyko: Tech Lead
Jeff Jarvis: Scrum Master
Derry Spann: Dev
Michael Berlet: Dev

Doing some quick learning about QA testing on Udemy!


### What I actually ended up doing

EOD:
* Reset AIDE password
* Logged into GFE
* Java/Javascript Training
* Got connected up with Taiyangshou, my new team.
