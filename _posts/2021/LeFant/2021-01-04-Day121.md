## Next Steps

TigerTest team was defunded at the end of 2020, and so far I have not heard anything from Le'Fant/BAH as to what I will be doing next. 

Joe Evans let me know that they (BAH) would find "something" for me, but it was left rather vague. 

As a result, I've started applying for jobs and looking for temp/part-time work just in case I get the email saying "We don't have anything for you..."

I had an interview this morning at 10am with QCode, an affiliate startup of QBS Learning (educational publishing house out of NYC). 

They reached out to me based on my experience. 
Here is a summary of the opportunity:
* Part-time
* Work as a consultant (either a Subject Matter Expert or as a teacher)
* ~10 hours/week
* QCode is working on an all-in-one solution for AP Computer Science teachers (LMS, content, etc.)
* Pay would be deliverable-based and in the $35-50/hour range

### What I actually ended up doing

EOD:
* Checked BAH email for updates
* Logged into GFE
* Emailed Le'fant inquiring about new project and how to track hours...still no response
* Interview prep
* Interviewed with QCode (went well I think!)
* Completed and submitted December Status report for Le'fant
* Training- Java Programming Masterclass (Udemy)
* Look for work/jobs and apply (looking at State Farm jobs)
