Hello Keith! I am new to Booz Allen and QA testing (just moved over from being a dev on TigerTest) and I have a lot of questions on the day-to-day ‘how-to’ of being a QA. I’ve watched several trainings and read quite a few documents, and I am starting to get a handle on the “What” of QA testing, but could definitely use some help on the “How.” I know you and Quita are quite busy, but could we schedule some time soon to meet and go through the different processes (both in scrum team and within the overall QA team)? I am excited to jump in and help out with the testing effort, but just need a little help and guidance. Thank you in advance!
