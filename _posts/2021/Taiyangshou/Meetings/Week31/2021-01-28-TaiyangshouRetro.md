Questions:
* Where is the data coming from?
* How is it stored?
* Send to Docgen?
* How to interact with the Word doc?
* How does the app know which letter to generate?

Domain model objects -> docgen objects
* data points will be the red items in the letter templates
API model docgen data object

John Shipmann and Scott Thompson have been working on docgen up to this point

* What work is required to generate the letter?
* Is there a form in BFFS to put in a beneficiary name OR is it just automated?

BFFS Team Demo (Stephanie Riani)

Do we have a workflow doc for Fiduciary?

# Action Items
Look over Templates with data points - make sure they map to requirements
See if data input is same as fiduciary/beneficiary record
Need to look into BFFS RE: these requirements (Do these exist already?)

We need additional BFFS app knowledge (training video attached to slack channel)
