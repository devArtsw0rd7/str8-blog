## Daily Stand Up

Got messaged from Nate Carlson that I will be joining Taiyangshou. I will be working on Fiduciary ART (Agile Release Train) as a QA Engineer.  

Today is my first day with Team T! Quick introductions... seems like I may be working with Julius Alipala, who is currently Taiyangshou's QA I believe.

Taiyangshou:
Matt Fetyko: Tech Lead
Jeff Jarvis: Scrum Master
Derry Spann: Dev
Michael Berlet: Dev

Others:
Allison Tumminia- Didn't meet her
Katie Fessler- Technical Requirements Analyst

Clark Spillane- Documentation/Requirements


Doing some quick learning about QA testing on Udemy!
