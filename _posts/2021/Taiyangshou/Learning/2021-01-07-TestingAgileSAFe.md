Testing in the Scaled Agile Framework

Large Solution Level
* Business outcomes are the focus
* Testing & QA can plan & measure business outcomes
* Communicate the business goals to the team
* Coordinate testing at the strategic level
* Communicate the value of testing to the rest of the org
* Equip teams with the training and tools they need for success

Program Level
* Agile Release Train (ART)
* A long-lived team of Agile teams, which, along with other stakeholders, develops and delivers solutions
* Uses a series of fixed-length iterations within a PROGRAM INCREMENT (PI) time box
* Each ART is typically a virtual organization (50-125 people) that plans, commits, and executes together
* Cross-functional ARTs have all the capabilities needed to define, implement, test, and deploy new system functionality
  * Software, hardware, firmware, DevOps, and others
  * Has the ability to define, implement, test, and deploy new system functionality
* An ART operates with the goal of achieving a continuous flow of value
* Most people are dedicated to the train full-time

GOAL: continuous flow of value to the customer

Long Train Running
* Define new functionality in code (and test)
* Implement
* Acceptance test
* Deploy

Acceptance tests are aligned to user stories
Acceptance/TDD tests tend to be very general and basic
What about tests beyond TDD?

*User Story*
Feature
As a software user I want to do ______ so that _______
Acceptance Criteria

Cross-Functional Teams Across Disciplines

Team 1- Design, Build, Test

Roles in ART
* Business owners
* Customers
* System Team (Design, build, test, integrate)
* Shared Services (support roles- security, architects, etc.)

PI Objectives steer the collection of feedback and information

Program level of SAFe helps with team-to-team integration testing

### Team Level Testing
* Core value- "Built-in quality"
* Test Driven Development
* Paired working
* Testers can take a leading role to learn agile methods

Who coordinates testing?
Who answers tough questions from C-Suite?
Who improves processes?

Have a good test strategy!
