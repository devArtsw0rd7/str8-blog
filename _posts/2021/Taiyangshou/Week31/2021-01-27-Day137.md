## Daily Stand Up
## Yesterday
EOD:
* Worked through GitHub issues for Core & BFFS
* QA Sync at noon
* Sat on the phone with ESD trying to get my CAG up and running (emailing back and forth at this point, have a phone call on Thursday or Friday to get that worked out)
* I have another QA meeting at 10
* Worked on my status report
* Perhaps issues are related to the way I'm accessing the tunnel? I have a script from my last team, but I think that may be the issue. Does anyone have documentation on how to setup the devvpn script?
* C & F Release Meeting
