# Scrum Team Responsibilities
* Test dev stories (manually via Jira)
  * When do I start creating tests for stories in the sprint? (Can I start creating the tests before devs are finished, or should I wait to create them when the devs have moved them to "Done" in the Jira Workflow?)
  * How are Test plans used? Should I create a test plan at the beginning of the sprint and then execute the plan once devs have moved their stories to "Done?" or should I use the Xray Test Plan Board to create folders per Sprint and use Test Plans around specific features/stories/etc.
  * Am I responsible for marking my tests within a specific feature (Fiduciary, for example) within the Xray Test Repository?
  * For our current sprint items, what will the QA process look like?
  * What is the workflow/process? Anything different from the 'Rational to Jira' QA documentation?


# QA Non-scrum responsibilities
* On a daily basis, what should I be doing?
* 508 Defects?
* So I see people chatting about testing on the dqsa channel... what is this, and what are my responsibilities vis a vis the items going on in the dqsa channel?
* What is the process for going through bugs on the QA Dashboard?
* When trying to reproduce defects in IE11 VM on a mac, how do I access the CI&D dashboard?


# General Questions
* As a QA on Fiduciary, will I need to pull down Core and Fiduciary, or will only the devs need to do this? (Black box testing or White box testing?)
* If they are not doing UI changes, how do I go in and test those items?
*
