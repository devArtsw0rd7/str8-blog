## Daily Stand Up
## Yesterday
* DSU
* Checked on Chris' test data
* setup Week 45 blog
* QA Meeting was cancelled, so I got my SOCKS proxy working
* Tweaked some data for the closed/cancelled stories
* Tested and closed out VBMSD-93081 & VBMSD-93162
* Started looking at 93337, but it looks like it may be missing a few things, so I need to finish up annotating the generated template


## TODAY
* Scrum test defects/stories
  
## TOMORROW

### Items from Team Members/Planning

### Impediments

## TODO

### General Questions  
  
### What I actually ended up doing
EOD:
* Tested VBMSD-93337, failed due to missing a few items in the template
* Retested VBMSD-93337- passed and moved to Done.
* Tested VBMSD-101859- passed and moved to Done.
