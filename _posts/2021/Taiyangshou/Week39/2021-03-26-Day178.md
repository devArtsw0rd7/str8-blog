## Daily Stand Up
## Yesterday
EOD:
* Tested defects 78919 & 78921- both FAILED due to continued mis-mapping of misuse determination date
* Tested VBMSD-76380- Passed, but uncovered a bug as well
  * Defect where a blank page is being inserted into the attached enclosure
  * Couldn't work on filing the defect because DEV DEGRADED, and TST doesn't have the feature I'm trying to test yet...
* Wrote test script VBMSTM-61183 for story VBMSD-78096 (couldn't test as changes were not in TST and DEV was DEGRADED 10:45 am MT)
