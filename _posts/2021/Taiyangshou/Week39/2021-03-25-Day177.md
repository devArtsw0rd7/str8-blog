### What I actually ended up doing
EOD:
* Tested defects 78919 & 78921- both FAILED due to continued mis-mapping of misuse determination date
* Tested VBMSD-76380- Passed, but uncovered a bug as well
  * Defect where a blank page is being inserted into the attached enclosure
  * Couldn't work on filing the defect because DEV DEGRADED, and TST doesn't have the feature I'm trying to test yet...
* Wrote test script VBMSTM-61183 for story VBMSD-78096 (couldn't test as changes were not in TST and DEV was DEGRADED 10:45 am MT)
* Tested VMBSD-78096- passed and moved to Done.
* Retested VBMSD-76380- passed and moved to Done.
* Wrote test script VMBSTM-61066 for story VBMSD-77892
* Tested VBMS-77892- passed and moved to Done.
