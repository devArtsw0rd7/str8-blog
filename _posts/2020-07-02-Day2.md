## Trainings, trainings, trainings

So now that my first round of paperwork is complete, I received some emails about getting set up in the government training portal. 

Lots of setting up accounts, usernames, etc., then I started working on my first two trainings regarding data privacy, HIPAA, encryption, secure communications, etc. Standard fare, but done well.

I used Safari (fast, reliable, works well with handoff, etc.), but it was giving me a bit of trouble with the media-rich trainings. At the end of the second training I had to screenshot my completion page rather than signalling to the system that I had completed the tranining. I'll get that figured out on Monday...

Logged my hours in the timesheet system, and then received an email re: July 4th. Because this weekend is July 4th, the "observance" is tomorrow (Friday), so no work tomorrow! 

Week 1, accomplished!
