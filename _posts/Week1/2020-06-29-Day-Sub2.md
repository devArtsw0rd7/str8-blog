## First Day Gettin' Stuff Done

I received my offer, signed the digital contract, and we're off to the races!

I work for an IT company that specializes in serving larger government contractors, so there will be lots of on-boarding work in the coming days and weeks to get clearance, authorization, etc. to be able to access government servers.

Today I received an email from my employer about my development machine (A Macbook!), so hopefully that will come soon.

## This is what work looks like

I set up a new user on my personal MacBook Air to work from until my work dev machine gets here (referenced Frankie Valentine's dev.to post: <https://dev.to/v3frankie/setup-your-mac-for-development-2020-edition-1c8a>). Spent the rest of the day reading e-mails, interpreting PowerPoint slides, and beginning the process of filling out forms. 

I also set up an appointment at the government office for Wednesday in Denver.
