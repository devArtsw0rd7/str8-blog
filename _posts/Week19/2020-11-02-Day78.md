## Standup- Sprint 40.1
  
### Friday
EOD: DSU, Retro, Planning. Closed PEN-5545. Met with Joe to plan out next week. Met with AC to confirm the bug fix and discuss defect PEN-5760 (Pre-Discharge Claim Types), which we figured out is a Scenario configuration rather than a bug. I will meet with Mel on Monday to determine what an appropriate default should be. "Fixing" PEN-5760 may involve creating a new claims Scenario, but we can discuss how we want to handle that on Monday. Tried updating my DEV BIP password, but my aide creds wouldn't go through. I'll try and figure that out this weekend so I don't lose access. Happy Halloween!
