## Standup- Sprint 40.1
  
### Friday
EOD: Worked with AC to continue engineering the solution to PEN-5545. Met with Mel to confirm military service dates. Went to cardiologist appointment, then continued work on PEN-5545. My fix is passing written tests (accounting for future dates and modifying RAD accordingly), but the BIRLS update is encountering inconsistent errors when I run it through vetgen-ui.
