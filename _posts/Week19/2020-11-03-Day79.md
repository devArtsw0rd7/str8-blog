### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: Implemented and completed PEN-4334 (Add confirmation step to delete actions). Code reviewed with AC, and the changes are pushed to Master, workflow set to Ready for QA. Talked briefly with Michael Nuss and logged his feedback regarding scrolling behavior in the vetgen-ui tool (will talk breifly with Joe tomorrow to see if this is something we want to add to the tool). Updated req.txt cryptography module from version 3.1 to version 3.2 to patch an RSA decryption/Bleichenbacher timing vulnerability (we received an urgent alert notification in the vetgen-ui GitHub repo). Updated Jira tasks.
