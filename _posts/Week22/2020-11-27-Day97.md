## Standup- Sprint 42.1
  
### Yesterday
EOD:
* DSU, Grooming prep, Grooming
* Worked on PEN-6882
* Did code reviews for Chad and Greg
* MVP functionality for PEN-6882 exists, but I will need to implement a custom Snackbar class in order to change the color of the snackbar. If you change the App to Light Theme, you can more easily see both snackbars (black snackbar on white background). I'll work on finishing this up on Friday.

### Today
* Start Le'fant status report
* Code reviews
* Look more into the threading issue for PEN-6882
### Items from Team Members/Grooming
* Look through Chad's service/operation sort code
* Read through/write questions/point PEN-5311

#### Grooming Questions/Thoughts
* Is the 3rd subtask really a story?

### Tomorrow
Pull in next story, work on Le'fant status report 
### Impediments
None
### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: 
* DSU, dev sync
* Worked with AC, Greg, & Chad on PEN-6882 to create a custom class that allows us to modify the color of the snackbar (to contrast with the darker background). Still need to review this on Monday with devs.
* In the process, made easy snackbar notifications update to duplicate and delete scenarios
* Worked on Le'fant status report
* Le'fant meeting
