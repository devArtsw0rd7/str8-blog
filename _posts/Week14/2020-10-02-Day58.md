## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: Worked through some documentation resources that Patrick Soisson sent over. He also gave us a list of 3-4 people as POC's, and Cameron. Got an email about resetting my @ne.bah.com password. The email instructions don't seem to support the workflow for sub-contractors; I may need some help with that tomorrow. Checked VA Email, and my GFE has been shipped.

### Today
* Work on SAML token
* Work on Save bug
* May update the documentation with respect to other 'hidden' prerequisites needed to access the tool (such as VA GitHub access, etc. as per our support channel discussion with Jason Dorman - adding dept-of-veterans-affairs to organizations)
   
### Tomorrow
  
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing

### Daily Workflow
* Login
* Update/Setup Weekly Blog Posts
* Open Jira
* Check lefant email
* Check BAH email
* Check VA email
* Connect to Tunnel (if necessary)
* Open GitHub Desktop
* Open VS Code
