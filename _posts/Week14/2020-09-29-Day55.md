## Standup

### Yesterday
* The structure of the WSSE headers is still off and the error we run into is:
       gov.va.vba.vbms.ws.VbmsWSException: WssVerification Exception - Security Verification Exception GUID: a3d4982d-934a-4dd5-94f4-422d4bced934
* When we index splunk for the GUID given as listed above, we only get one partial response:

### Today
* Work on SAML token
* Finish Le'fant monthly report
   
### Tomorrow
* 
  
### Impediments
  
### From other teammates

### FEATURE IDEAS/BUG FIXES


### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: Continued working through SAML token issues. Worked with Patrick Soisson to configure the SOAPUI request (which worked in DEV), but the Test environment continues to throw an SSLHandshakeException, and so PEN-4487 is now blocked. Andrew C and I pivoted to work on PEN-5258: Refactor save scenario functionality. Andrew C and I were also able to access Teams with our @ne.bah.com email addresses.
