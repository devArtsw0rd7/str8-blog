## Standup
* Standup was cancelled... I think everyone is in "PI," whatever that is. 
  
### Yesterday
L24:
Worked with Andrew & Sean on Saml Token Story. We were able to have a continued conversation with Patrick about the error codes we are receiving in both the project and SoapUI. He gave us a list of POCs to reach out to that may be able to help us with the eFolder security error in the project. Yesterday afternoon, Andrew & I continued to look at the save defect, and  whiteboarded a bit.
N24: The First POC is unsure of the error and Saml integration so we will reach out to the next POC in the AM. While waiting on a response I will continue to work on the Save defect. 

### Today
* Work on SAML token
* Work on Save bug
   
### Tomorrow
  
### Impediments

### What I actually ended up doing
EOD: Worked through some documentation resources that Patrick Soisson sent over. He also gave us a list of 3-4 people as POC's, and Cameron. Got an email about resetting my @ne.bah.com password. The email instructions don't seem to support the workflow for sub-contractors; I may need some help with that tomorrow. Checked VA Email, and my GFE has been shipped.
