## Standup

### Yesterday

* UI/API w/ React/JavaScript research


### Today
* Still working through making some sense of all the information available in Slack
* Building some QA Domain Knowledge/Onboarding Documentation
* Ask Joe E how to do the 'burn up' process and 'Shadow task' in Jira

### Impediments
Get PIV on Thursday

### Next Week
* Splunk
* Demo on Thursday

### Items from team members
* Jira training
* Workflow domain knowledge doc
* Code Review (ShadowTask with Sean K)
* Update tasks in Jira
* Look at the burndown to see how the sprint is going

### What I actually did today
* Started to learn React, but the instructor recommended upgrading my Vanilla JavaScript chops, so...
* I went through his Vanilla JavaScript Crash Course... mostly reviewing basics... for some reason I can't bring myself to skip through... afraid I'll miss something.

### Future onboarding items (per Joe Evans)
Xray test management
CI/CD Dashboard
Citrix Desktop Access Gateway (CAG)
JumpBox access
Webtest images for Share

#### Data Creation Process Meta Workflow
* Make sure the work you are doing is in a task/sub-task
* Update the Story (Backlog => IN PROCESS/READY FOR DEV, ETC.)
* Research work should be tracked as a task/sub-task if it is significant
