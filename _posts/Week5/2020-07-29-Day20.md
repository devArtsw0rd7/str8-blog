### Items from team members
* Dry run of the tool demo for tomorrow


### What I actually did today
* Started to learn React, but the instructor recommended upgrading my Vanilla JavaScript chops, so...
* I went through his Vanilla JavaScript Crash Course... mostly reviewing basics... for some reason I can't bring myself to skip through... afraid I'll miss something.

### Future onboarding items (per Joe Evans)
PIES? (Joe MacNamara)
Pension Workflows (with Mel's document(s))
Xray test management
CI/CD Dashboard

#### Data Creation Process Meta Workflow
* Make sure the work you are doing is in a task/sub-task
* Update the Story (Backlog => IN PROCESS/READY FOR DEV, ETC.)
* Research work should be tracked as a task/sub-task if it is significant
