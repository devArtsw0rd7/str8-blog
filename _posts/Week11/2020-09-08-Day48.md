## Standup

### Friday
EOD: Completed and submitted Le'fant August 2020 Status Report. Built eFolderUploadService initializeUpload() SOAP request as part of the work for PEN-4487 (Shout out to Sean, Andrew, Ansley, Mel, and JoeMc for their help!!!). Still need to determine the specific docType, source, and vaReceiveDate for the upload, then we should be able to get a token back which will be used in the second part of the UploadService call, uploadDocument().

### Today
* Whiteboarding session with Sean and Andrew
* Research creating an executable- issues (packaging all known and hidden dependencies)
  * TO CREATE A WINDOWS exectuable, you have to run pyinstaller on Windows machine. Need to use Wine for this or create a windows VM to create the Windows executable (not sure how this would work with Tunnel/proxy settings?) -> Need to make a step by step for Mel or walk him through? 
  
  ### Cross-compile a Python script into a Windows executable using [PyInstaller under Wine](https://www.andreafortuna.org/2017/12/27/how-to-cross-compile-a-python-script-into-a-windows-executable-on-linux/) 
* `sudo apt-get install wine`
* `wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/python-2.7.9.amd64.msi`
* `wine msiexec /i python-2.7.9.amd64.msi /qb`

### NOTE -> If you need to compile for 32-bit .exe, install wine32
* `sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine32`


  
  * Pyinstaller limitations
    * hidden imports
    * relative imports in entry-point scripts
    * Can't cross-compile (need a build machine for each targeted OS)
  ### PyInstaller Workflow
  * `pip` should be installed
  * `pip install pyinstaller`
  * `pyinstaller --onefile vetgen.py`
  * dist folder->test folder
  * Add `-w`flag to prevent terminal window from opening up
  * Additional dependencies- NSIS 
    * Installer based on .zip file
    * provide path for dist/.exe file
    * Convert dist folder to .zip
    * point NSIS to the .zip file
* Update pre-req parser

*Wheels (whl) package (create a wheel and install in a virtual environment)
    * `sudo pip install --upgrade pip`
    * `sudo pip install wheel`
    * `sudo pip install unidecode`
    * `mkdir mywheels`
    * `pip wheel --wheel-dir=my_wheels Unidecode`
    * `cd my_wheels/` to confirm creation of .whl file
  * Install wheel in venv
    * `virtualenv venv_name`
    * `cd venv_name`
    * `source bin/activate`
    * Do pip install wheel if it didn't already
    * `pip install --wheel --no-index --find-links=/Users/lefant/my_wheels/ Unidecode`
    * `python`
    * Confirm by `import unidecode`
    * 

* Create Compiled version for Mac and Windows
* Update Jira with subtasks and names after whiteboarding session
* Setup blogs for this week and next
* Life stuff
