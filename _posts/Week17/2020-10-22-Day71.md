## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: We met with Joe Fetyko at 10 am who was able to provide us with quite a bit of documentation, SOAPUI projects, Java code, and notated examples related to VBMS requests. I contacted the Zeep developer and posted a question to Stack Overflow concerning our current blockage on PEN-4487. We Groomageddoned, then had a meeting with Brad Motley, who provided us with Java code and links to VBMS Core SOAPUI projects. We met with Joe and Ansley to touch base and prioritize next steps, then began consuming the documentation provided by Brad and Joe.
