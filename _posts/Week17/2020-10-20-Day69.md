## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: We created and successfully injected the timestamp with Zeep and some custom code patterned after the VAWS Plugin into our request security header. We are still unsure how to implement/inject the missing SOAP request security elements that went through with SOAPUI. We met with Joe and Ansley to determine appropriate POC's for securing SOAP web services. Sean reached out to Joe Fetico and set up a meeting for Wednesday at 10 am. I reached out to Chalmer Lowe, Patrick Soisson, and Cameron Williams for help with the same. We built the SOAP request based on the successful SOAPUI request as a test to see what errors we received... this ended up with a 'WssVerification Exception - Please make sure the specified encryption key alias is correct.'
