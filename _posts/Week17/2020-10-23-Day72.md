## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: Fixed PEN-5473 (Some buttons require double click). Still needs to be code reviewed before being Ready for QA. Pulled in PEN-4392 (Remove operation tooltip bleed) and created custom toolbar class to fix the tooltip bleed, then pivoted to PEN-5693 (Restricted characters cause app crashes, tool corruption) at Joe E's direction. Found a Python package that will sanitize filenames (pathvalidate). Installed, imported, and implemented it, but need base save functionality restored in order to test properly. Worked on Le'Fant status report a bit.
