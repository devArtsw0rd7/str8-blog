## Standup
  
### Friday
EOD: Andrew C and I worked on PEN-4487 in the morning. Made small progress, but still ultimately running into AttributeError or SSL Certificate Error depending on our cert configuration. We pivoted to looking at some bugs, and were able to fix defects PEN-5437 and PEN-5438. Andrew C then focused on the Save defect (PEN-5258) and I started researching a fix for the Tooltip bleed defect (PEN-4392).
