## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: Working through PEN-4487. Was able to solve the
SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED ERROR
with this command:
conda install -c conda-forge certifi
Unfortunately, now just getting the old:
File "/Users/lefant/opt/anaconda3/envs/vetgen2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/zeep/wsdl/bindings/soap.py", line 185, in process_reply
    client.wsse.verify(doc)
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'verify'
Reached out in the #python channel, and Collin Paran responded and gave us some links to setup our request in Postman which should then hopefully generate some Python code that may help us move forward. :crossed_fingers:
We have a meeting with him tomorrow at 10am EST.
I set up the Postman request to the eFolderReadService according to Collin's info, but got a 503 Service Unavailable Error because DEV was deploying... so I'll try again in the AM!
