## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: 
Worked on PEN-4487. We found documentation on PyJKS and built JksManager class to incorporate the PyJKS library (simpler, more Pythonic and streamlined way to manage the certs, and keystores). We were able to see all of our certs and keys using the new class. Today we need to wire it in to our soap request and start testing the responses. Updated AIDE password. Still need to update it in my codebase and other sites.

### Today

* Wire in JksManager to get the request to eFolerReadService connecting

* Grooming session cancelled to focus on commmits
