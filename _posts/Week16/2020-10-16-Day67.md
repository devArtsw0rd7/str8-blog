## Standup
  
### Yesterday
EOD: We found a discrepancy with our zeep request versus our SOAPUI request. We were looking at the raw output from both SOAPUI and zeep. We found that there is a wsu timestamp (web service timestamp utility) object in the soap request. The wsu timestamp is being injected by SOAPUI in our request (the request we have in our code), and then being sent out to the endpoint. Our zeep output does not have this wsu timestamp. We didn't know it was needed. So we are working to figure out how to generate the wsu timestamp and inject it into our zeep request.
